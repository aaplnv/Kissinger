#
# Now we are ready to set up Kissinger
#

#
# Set here token for your telegram bot
# Use @Botfather bot in Telegram to create new one and get more instructions
TOKEN:

# Set here domain with DTA instance
# Don't forget about protocol (http/https) and leave it with slash in the end
URL: http://kispython.ru/api/v1/

#
# Set here your SQLite database path
SQLITE: sqlite:///kissinger.sqlite
#
# Rename this file
# From default_config.yml to config.yml
# Or you can change config path in app, but it's too hard, isn't it?

#

# Now it's ready to deploy
